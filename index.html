Historians, particularly medieval historians, are vulnerable to the charge that
they concentrate their attention upon success—on the successful dynasties, institutions
and ideas—and that they thereby misrepresent the past. Thus the political historian sees
the ninth century as the crucial period in the evolution of a unitary English kingdom.
The four powerful and independent Anglo-Saxon kingdoms existing in 800—Northumbria, Mercia,
East Anglia and Wessex—had been reduced by the end of the century to one, Wessex. But this
was achieved not through the assertion of West Saxon supremacy—the overlordship that Egbert
won in 829 lasted but a year—but by the destruction of the other kingdoms by Viking conquest
and their partial replacement by new Viking states. Though it is clear to us with hindsight
that Alfred's claim to be the ruler of all the English not under Danish rule was the germ of
the unification of England under his descendants, no one can have known, when Alfred died in 899,
that new Viking armies were not being raised in the Scandinavian homelands to crush the remaining
English kingdom. At that time, for most Englishmen, the deepest impression must have been of the
defeat and destruction of the English polity and culture.</p>
